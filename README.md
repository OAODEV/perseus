# concept

Percius provides libraries and a server to conviniently wrangle debug messages

The library is essentially an alternative to print statement debugging. Send
debug messages to the server and view them in a browser instead of finding and
watching pring statements.

The server accepts messages sent by the library and puts them into a nice web
page.
